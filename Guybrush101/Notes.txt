to-do list
implement
- atmosphereCurve			[DONE]
- maxThrust --> fuelFlow	[DONE]
- Engine Names				--> Supposed to be change to the engine name. Does apparently not work well
- propellantIgnoreForIsp	[DONE]
- propellantDrawGauge		[postponed] --> Implemented but commented out pending decition about validity
- heatProduction			[DONE]
- EngineType				[DONE]


Should these be implemented?
